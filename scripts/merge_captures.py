"""Put several captures of one floor into a single scan, ready to be aligned by hand.

Four walks of the same library floor are four ARKit sessions, each with its own
origin, and nothing in the data says how they sit relative to one another. The
geometry cannot say either: a floor of parallel shelf rows correlates with
itself at many angles, so the best fit beats a rival at a completely different
turn by a per cent or two. Somebody who was standing there has to place them.

This makes that possible rather than doing it. Every capture's rooms are copied
into one scan and laid out side by side so none starts on top of another, and a
`rooms.json` records which nodes came from which walk. The workspace reads that
file, shows a "Combine rooms" tab, and lets the owner drag and turn each walk
into place on the floor plan and save the result.

What it does not do is merge the LiDAR or the photographs. Those can only be
placed once the alignment is known, so they come after: this writes the boxes
the owner aligns, and the saved alignment is what a full-floor bake would then
be built from.
