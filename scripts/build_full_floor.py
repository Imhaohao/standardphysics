"""Turn a placed set of walks into one scan carrying all of their measurements.

`merge_captures.py` puts several walks of one floor into a single scan as boxes
and leaves them where they were captured. Somebody then drags each walk into
place in the workspace and saves, because the geometry cannot say how they fit:
a floor of parallel shelf rows correlates with itself at many angles.

This takes that saved placement and applies it to everything the boxes stood
for. Each walk was uploaded as a scan of its own, and the merged scan's
`rooms.json` names it. That scan's LiDAR mesh and camera poses are moved by the
same motion the owner gave its boxes, so the photographs keep pointing at the
surfaces they photographed. Its painted surface is moved the same way and
joined with the others, so the floor looks the way each walk already looked.

The motion is recovered rather than trusted: every box's placed position is a
correspondence against where the phone measured it, and those go through the
registration fit, which refuses when they do not agree on one rigid motion.

The mesh and the poses are ARKit's, Y up, while the boxes are ours, Z up with
each walk's floor at zero. A turn on the floor plan is therefore a turn about
ARKit's Y, and each walk's own floor height has to come out on the way in.
Every walk leaves in one shared ARKit frame whose floor is at Y = 0.
