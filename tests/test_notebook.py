"""The reactive notebook still runs, and still runs on the real evaluator.

Nothing else imports `notebooks/scenario_sweep.py`, so a rename in the
evaluation package would break it quietly. marimo executes every cell when the
notebook is run as a program, which is enough to catch a name that moved, a
value defined in two cells, and a cell that references another cell's local.

It also pins the two properties the notebook is built on: the sweep's cache key
does not move when the slider being swept moves, and a knob that sets a
dimension does not claim one the routine took away.
