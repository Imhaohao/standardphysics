/**
 * Every walk of a floor as the photographs found it, standing where its boxes stand.
 *
 * Four walks can only be fitted together by somebody who recognises them, and
 * the boxes give nothing to recognise: white, featureless, and one room much
 * like another. Each walk was uploaded as its own scan and photographed onto
 * its mesh, so what gets dragged here is the shelving and the signage rather
 * than a cluster of blocks.
 *
 * A walk still on its way, or one never photographed, simply does not draw. Its
 * boxes are underneath and keep it draggable, so a missing mesh costs detail
 * and never the ability to place the room.
 *
 * What draws is the photographed model, not the scanned surface itself. Four
 * captures of one library floor hold some sixteen million measured faces
 * between them and no browser gets through that; the models wearing the same
 * photographs are a tenth of the size and a thousandth of the geometry.
 *
 * A walk whose model will not load says so in the console rather than leaving
 * an empty floor and no reason for it, which is how this went unnoticed once
 * already.
