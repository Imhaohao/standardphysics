 * a clear floor space reach into knee and toe clearance under an element,

 * piece and moves and turns with it when a layout is rearranged.
 *
 * The grid starts at the corner at the piece's local -x, -y and runs along
 * its local x for `columns` and its local y for `rows`. Each cell records
 * whether the floor there was seen, and how high the space above that floor
 * stays open before the mesh shows anything: a leg, a panel, an apron, the
 * underside of the top, or a chair pushed in. Whether any of it counts is
 * the rule pack's to say, not this record's.
