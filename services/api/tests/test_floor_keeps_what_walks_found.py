"""A floor joined from several walks keeps what discovery found in each of them.

RoomPlan boxes the furniture categories Apple ships. The counter at a library's
entrance, the standing whiteboards and the security gates are found afterwards,
by discovery on each walk's own photos. A floor built from the walks' RoomPlan
boxes alone lost all of them, so none could be picked on the floor.

This runs against a real floor of Moffitt Library and its four walks, as they
sit in a development database, and skips where that database is absent.
