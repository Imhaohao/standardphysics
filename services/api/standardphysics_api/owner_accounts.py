"""Accounts the phone makes before anyone signs in, and the two ways to keep them.

The walk uploads under a guest account the phone makes on first launch, so the
owner is never stopped to sign in (docs/UX.md, first-run rules). During the
measuring wait they can keep it with Sign in with Apple or an email and a
password. Signing in to an account that already exists moves the guest's shops
into it.
