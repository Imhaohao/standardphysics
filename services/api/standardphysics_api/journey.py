"""Where a shop is in the owner's journey, and the one thing to do next.

docs/UX.md names six stages. Set up happens on the phone before the server
knows the shop, so the server derives the other five from what's done: the
upload, the in-shop answers and photos, the measuring, the counter and the
customer path, the follow-ups and the checklist. Nothing about the stage is
stored, so no screen can disagree with another about it.

The next step's title is written here once, for the app's home card and the
web alike.
