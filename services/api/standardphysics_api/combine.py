"""Combining several rooms into one by hand, each dragged as one rigid group.

The owner aligns the scans in the workspace and saves their placements. A
placement moves every node in a room the same way: rotate about the room's
centroid, then slide it on the floor. Nodes stay a pure rotation about the
vertical axis plus a translation, which is all a RoomPlan surface carries.

The math here mirrors the web's `lib/room-groups.ts` exactly, so the preview
before saving and the graph after saving agree to the float.
