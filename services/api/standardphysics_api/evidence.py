"""Evidence closure: derived readiness from stored bytes, bundles and jobs.

K froze this for the pilot contract (coordinator plan item 7a). B owns the
persisted lifecycle hardening: this module only closes bundles, tells callers
when exactly one semantic job is due, and assembles the status a client reads.
Nothing here claims a detection ran or an object exists.
