"""Rearranging: check a layout while it is being dragged, and save one.

Moves go through Lane C's `apply_moves` and `violations`, the same hard
constraints the fix agent works under, so a drag can never save something the
agent would reject. Whatever sits on a moved piece goes with it. While
planning, the owner may also drag a built-in fixture such as a counter: that is
construction, held to the rules for a relocated fixture instead of refused. A
saved layout says what the room is now, and construction has not happened yet,
so saving still refuses a moved fixture.
