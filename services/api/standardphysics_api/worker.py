"""Background threads that run queued jobs in order, one per lane (`LOOP_NAMES`).

Run one API process per database. Before it touches the queue the worker takes
an exclusive lock on a file beside the database; a second process finds the
lock held, says so in the log, and serves requests without running any job.
Jobs are claimed atomically, and at startup every job left running is queued
again, except a simulation, which is failed so that a restart never spends a
second budget of paid model calls (`repo.fail_interrupted_simulations`), and a
job whose runs `max_job_interruptions` restarts in a row have cut short, which
is failed so that an input that kills the server can't bring it down for ever
(`repo.requeue_interrupted_jobs`). The lock is what makes that safe: no other
live process can be running one of them.

Neither loop stops on an error. A job's own failure is recorded on its row; an
error outside any job, such as a database that stays locked, is logged and the
loop tries again after a wait that doubles up to a minute. Writing how a job
ended waits out a locked database for SETTLE_PATIENCE_SECONDS at most and any
other database error not at all; a job that can't be settled is left running
for the next start to queue again, and /health/ready names it until then.

On the server every job's heavy stage runs in a spawned child process
(`in_own_process`): photo bakes when `bake_in_own_process` is on, the other
kinds when `jobs_in_own_process` is on. The child gets the settings, never a
live connection, and opens the database and the store itself; a child still
running at its job's deadline is killed with everything it started, the job is
failed, and the loop moves on to the next job. A spawned child inherits none
of the parent's tracing, so each one starts Weave from the settings itself and
flushes it before it exits.
