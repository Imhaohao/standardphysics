"""A language model picks the layout from the menu of legal moves, for trying the rearranger in the web app.

Set SP_MENU_MODEL_URL to an OpenAI-compatible server (the local MLX server,
for example http://100.120.71.28:8090/v1) and SP_MENU_MODEL to the name it
serves. With both set, "See a layout that fixes this" builds the menu for the
finding the owner asked about, asks the model to choose, and returns its pick
with the model's reason. Without them, proposals come from the search as before.

This is a preview. The menu is built with the training checker, which treats
scan geometry marked "needs another look" as measured, so a pick can rest on a
measurement the production checks would still ask the owner to confirm.

The server is someone else's, so nothing it sends is trusted: a reply must
arrive within `reply_seconds`, fit in MAX_REPLY_BYTES, and be a chat
completion with a message in it, or `ask` raises `ModelReplyError` (or
`TimeoutError` for a slow one) instead of handing on something it can't read.
`ModelSlots` caps how many model calls run at once, per owner and in total.
