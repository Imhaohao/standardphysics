"""What the app asks an owner for, what they said, and what their answers change.

A scan can't see a handle's shape, feel a door's push or know whether customers
use the restroom. Those checks are known before the shop is measured, so the
app asks them while the owner is still standing in the shop (docs/UX.md,
screens 5 to 7). A check that finds a gap only after measuring adds a
follow-up, like the doorway width.

Answers change the findings when they are read, not by running the checks
again. The stored assessment stays what the scan measured, and `apply_answers`
lays the owner's answers over it. A number is checked against its rule at once.
A photo waits for a person on the team to look at it.
