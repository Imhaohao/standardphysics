"""Suggest a rearrangement: a model proposes, the measured checker decides.

A suggestion is a background job on its own worker lane, because a Fireworks
deployment at zero replicas takes minutes to start and the page should poll
rather than hold a request open that long:

    POST /api/scans/{id}/rearrangement-suggestion   queue a job for the latest revision
    GET  /api/scans/{id}/rearrangement-suggestion?revision=N   poll it, and learn if the feature is on

The job builds prompts for the whole scan or problem windows, then asks up to
four times with checker feedback after a rejected answer. It scores each with
`training.reward.score_completion`: the edits parser, `apply_moves`,
`violations` (fixture, keep-clear, travel and room-to-use rules included) and
the gate with improvement required, as the fix agent uses it. That training
checker only chooses. What the owner reads, the findings before and after and
the sentence about them, comes from the production assessment the arrange
panel runs, so the two always tell the same story. Nothing is saved.

The optional Fireworks path still manages its deployment lease. OpenRouter is
the default and needs no GPU deployment.
