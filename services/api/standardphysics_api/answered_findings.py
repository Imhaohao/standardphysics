"""The findings as the owner's answers leave them.

A question finding stays a question in the stored assessment. When it's read,
an answer turns it into a pass or a problem: a number is checked against the
rule straight away, and a photo becomes a result once a person on the team has
looked at it. A "no" to the restroom or inside-door question removes the
findings that only mattered if the answer was yes.
