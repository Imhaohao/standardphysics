"""The stage each job kind runs, on a worker thread or in a child process the worker spawned.

`JobHandlers` holds what every stage needs: the database, the store, the
stages, the settings and the in-memory state a stage boundary reads. `Worker`
builds on it with the loops that claim jobs and settle them. A child process
runs the same handlers through `run_job`, so a job's results land in the same
place wherever it ran.
