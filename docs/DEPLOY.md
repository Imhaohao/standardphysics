# Running Standard Physics for real shops

One Ubuntu Droplet, one Block Storage volume, three containers from the image
in `Dockerfile`. Caddy terminates TLS and is the only thing bound to a public
port; the API holds the scans and runs the reconstruction worker; the
workspace serves the pages.

The phone talks to the API directly rather than through the workspace, because
a scan bundle can reach the 1 GB ceiling in `Settings.max_artifact_bytes` and
there is no reason to push that through a Next rewrite.

```

                                          ├── Caddy ──┬── api  + /mnt volume
 Browser ─── https://standardphysics.app ───┘           └── web
```

Everything lives in `deploy/digitalocean/`.

## What you need first

- **A domain.** Two names, one for the API and one for the workspace. The
  iPhone app refuses a plain `http://` address for anything but a machine on
  the local network, so a bare IP will not do: Let's Encrypt does not issue
  certificates for IP addresses.
- **A Droplet.** Ubuntu 24.04, 2 vCPU and 4 GB. The workspace is a Next build
  and a 2 GB box runs out of memory partway through it; `setup.sh` adds swap,
  which covers the gap but does not replace the memory.
- **A Block Storage volume**, 10 GB to start, attached to that Droplet. Scans
  go on it rather than the Droplet's own disk so the box can be rebuilt or
  resized without losing a shop.

## Provision the box

Point both names at the Droplet's public IP in DNS and let them resolve.
Caddy asks Let's Encrypt for a certificate on its first start, and that fails
if the names do not already point here.

Then, on the Droplet as root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Imhaohao/standardphysics.git
cd standardphysics/deploy/digitalocean
VOLUME_NAME=standardphysics-scans ./setup.sh
```

That installs Docker, mounts the volume, adds swap, closes every port but SSH
and the two Caddy needs, turns on unattended security updates, and installs
the logrotate rule for the deploy log. It never
formats a disk that already holds a filesystem, so running it again on a box
with scans on it is safe.

## Secrets

```bash
cp env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
```

Fill in the two domains, `SCANS_PATH` as the script printed it, and the keys.
There is no session secret to generate: a session is a random token the API
stores only as a hash, so nothing signs it.

Set a spend limit on the OpenRouter account and turn on zero data retention
before the first shop scans anything. Every scan sends photographs of
somebody's business to that endpoint.

Leave `WANDB_*` empty. Tracing a deployment that holds real shops sends their
rooms somewhere else.

## Start it

```bash
GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f caddy    # watch the certificate arrive
curl https://api.standardphysics.app/health
```

The first build takes a while: it installs the Python packages and builds the
workspace on the box.

`GIT_SHA` names the commit being built. The image is tagged
`standardphysics:<sha>` as well as `standardphysics:latest`, and the API
reports the commit at `/health/details`, which is how a rollback knows what
it is rolling back from. Left out, the tag falls back to `latest` and the API
reports `unknown`.

The compose file caps the API at 3.2 GB and 1.75 cores and the workspace at
512 MB and one core, sized so a photo bake of up to about 3 GB fits and Caddy,
Docker and SSH still have room. The comment at the top of
`docker-compose.yml` has the arithmetic. On a bigger Droplet, raise them
there.

Logs are capped too, so a chatty week cannot fill the Droplet disk. Docker
keeps each container's output in at most five 20 MB files, which is as far
back as `docker compose logs` can reach. `setup.sh` installs
`deploy/digitalocean/logrotate.conf` as `/etc/logrotate.d/standardphysics`,
which rotates the deploy log once it passes 1 MB and keeps ten old files. A
box set up before that rule existed gets it by running `setup.sh` again.

## Blender

The image carries Blender 5.2.1, pinned, because the texture bake and the
picture beside each finding are rendered by it. Debian's package is no use:
`check_blender.py` shows 4.0.2 still advertises `*.usd` and cannot import a
USDZ, so the binary comes from blender.org.

Only `render_finding` and the texture bake need it, and only the bake has no
fallback, so a server without Blender looks like scans that work and reports
with no pictures in them. `doctor.sh` asks the container for its version.

It adds about 366 MB to the image, and blender.org publishes no arm64 Linux
build of this version, which is what keeps the Droplet on x86_64.

## Furniture refinement

Swapping photographed furniture for SPAR3D reconstructions needs a SPAR3D
virtualenv and source checkout that the image doesn't carry, so it is off
unless `SP_FURNITURE_PYTHON` and `SP_FURNITURE_SOURCE` name both. While it is
off no furniture job is queued, the workspace shows the painted scan as it is,
and `furniture_refinement` in `/health/details` says which setting is missing.

## When it will not start

```bash
./doctor.sh
```

It checks the configuration, the mount and its ownership, swap, the two names
in DNS, and every container's state, then prints the command to run for each
thing that is wrong. It changes nothing itself.

The symptom is almost never the cause here. Caddy reporting that its
dependency failed to start says only that the API exited, and the API usually
exited because it could not write to `/data`.

## Updating

From your own machine, which is the usual way:

```bash
scripts/deploy.sh
```

It pulls master on the Droplet, fetches the image CI tested for that commit,
and runs `doctor.sh`, streaming the lot back. Only one deploy runs at a time: a second is refused rather than
queued, because two of them racing to recreate a container leave the name
taken, the stack half torn down and the site answering 502. It stops if you have commits master does not, because the Droplet
pulls from GitHub and a deploy that quietly ships the previous commit is worse
than one that refuses. `SP_DEPLOY_HOST` moves it to another box.

Before the restart it drains the API. The restart stops the API, and a bake
interrupted ten minutes in starts again from nothing, so once the image is
ready the script turns on the drain flag through the API container:

```bash
docker compose exec api /opt/venv/bin/python -m standardphysics_api.drain on
```

The flag is a file, `/data/draining`, on the scans volume. While it is there,
every request that would queue new work gets 503 (finishing a walk, saving
or combining a layout, marking a counter, confirming a route, and asking for a
simulation or a texture all go through the same admission check in
`budgets.admit_new_job`). Each refusal comes with `Retry-After: 60` and says
"Standard Physics is updating; try again in a minute." Uploads of a walk's files carry on, because
their scan was admitted already and its job is queued only when the phone
finishes the walk. The worker starts no queued job but finishes the one it is
running, and `/health/details` reports `"draining": true`.

Then the script waits for the running job to finish, reading the `jobs` table
through the API container's own Python every five seconds for up to
`SP_DEPLOY_DRAIN_SECONDS`, 1200 by default. Queued jobs don't hold it up: they
wait in the database and the new worker takes them. It stops with exit code 75
if a job is still running at the end of that wait, and with 69 if it cannot
read the queue or set the flag at all, because a stopped or wedged API is when
nobody knows what it was doing. To deploy anyway in either case:

```bash
SP_DEPLOY_FORCE=1 scripts/deploy.sh
```

The order on the box is pull, fetch the image, drain, wait for the running job,
restart, check the new stack is serving, and turn the drain off. A pull (or a
build, below) takes minutes and the old API keeps serving and taking work
through it, so the drain starts only after the image is ready. A refused deploy
leaves the new image on the box, and running the script again reuses it.
Fetching or building also moves the `standardphysics:latest` tag to the new
image, so a bare `docker compose up -d` typed on the box without `GIT_SHA`
would start it.

The drain comes off on every way out of the script: after the new stack
passes its check, and on any failure before that (jobs still running, a queue
it cannot read, a stack that never comes up), so a failed deploy never leaves
the site refusing work. The new API does not clear the flag by itself when it
starts, so a deploy whose SSH session dies half way can leave it set. That
shows as `"draining": true` in `/health/details` and as shops getting the
"updating" message; clear it with
`docker compose exec api /opt/venv/bin/python -m standardphysics_api.drain off`
(`status` says whether it is on).

### The image CI tested

The `image` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds the image, runs
`scripts/smoke_image.sh` and the Blender regressions in it, and on a push to
master pushes that same image to GitHub's registry as
`ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics:candidate-<sha>`. The `publish` job waits
for every other job in the workflow (the Python suites, the contract drift
check, the web lint, typecheck, tests and build, the browser flow, and the
image job) and only then copies the candidate's manifest to
`ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics:<sha>`, unchanged, so the digest stays the
one that was tested. A commit with any failing check never gets the `<sha>`
tag. The publish job's summary on the Actions run records the digest.
Never deploy a `candidate-` tag by hand: it exists before the web checks
have finished. `scripts/deploy.sh` pulls that tag and
retags it `standardphysics:<sha>` on the box, so what serves traffic is the
exact image that passed CI, and the Droplet spends no time or memory building.

When the `<sha>` tag cannot be pulled, because CI has not finished with the
commit, a check failed, or the Droplet cannot read the package, the script
stops with exit code 66 and says which of those to look at. It does not fall
back to building, since a build on the box has passed none of CI's checks.
When you need to ship anyway, such as GitHub being down during an incident,
`SP_DEPLOY_BUILD=1 scripts/deploy.sh` builds from the checked-out commit on
the box, warns that the image is untested, and records the deploy as
`untested-local-build`. `SP_DEPLOY_IMAGE` points the script at another
registry repository.

**A person has to do this once, by hand.** GHCR packages start out private,
and until the Droplet can read this one every deploy is refused. Pick one:

- Make the package public: on GitHub, open the repository's Packages,
  choose `standardphysics`, then Package settings, and set its visibility to
  public. It holds nothing secret (the image is built from this public
  repository and carries no credentials), and nothing else is needed.
- Keep it private and log the Droplet in with a token that can only read
  packages: create a fine-grained or classic token with just `read:packages`,
  then on the box run
  `echo <token> | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-user> --password-stdin`.
  The login is saved in `/root/.docker/config.json` and outlives reboots;
  a token that expires makes deploys refuse again until it is replaced.

Either way, check it from the Droplet with
`docker pull ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics:<a master sha>`.

The base image is pinned by digest in the `Dockerfile` (`NODE_IMAGE`), so a
build on the box starts from the same bytes as CI's. Debian packages and the
Blender download are installed at build time; Blender is checked against its
published sha256, and the apt packages follow bookworm's security updates.

Two more CI jobs watch what goes into the image. `supply-chain` runs gitleaks
over every commit, pip-audit over `requirements.lock`, and `npm audit` over the
workspace's production dependencies at high severity and up.
`image-vulnerabilities` builds the image and fails when grype finds a critical
vulnerability that has a fixed version. Neither is in the publish job's
`needs`, so a new advisory against an unchanged dependency shows as a red
check on the commit without blocking a hotfix. The fix is a dependency bump:
`scripts/lock_python.sh` for Python, `npm update <package>` in `apps/web` for
the workspace, or a newer `NODE_IMAGE` digest for the base image. Every action
in the workflows is pinned to a commit SHA, with its version in a comment.

Nothing new can start between the queue read and the restart. A request that
passed admission a moment before the flag was set queues its job, and that job
waits for the new worker. A worker loop that read the flag just before it was
set can still claim one job, so the script waits two seconds before it first
reads the queue and sees that job as running. If a restart does interrupt a
job, which only `SP_DEPLOY_FORCE=1` allows, `requeue_interrupted_jobs` puts
every job left `running` back in the queue on the next start (a simulation is
marked failed instead, so a restart never pays for its model calls twice, and
so is a job that `SP_MAX_JOB_INTERRUPTIONS` restarts, three by default, have
cut short, until someone retries the scan).

After the restart the script waits for the new stack to prove it is the one
it deployed. Every five seconds it runs `deploy/digitalocean/check_serving.py`
inside the API container, which passes once `/health/ready` answers 200,
`/health/details` reports the commit just deployed, and the workspace serves
its sign-in page. The check runs in the container because the API publishes
no port, so those three go past Caddy. It then asks
`https://$APP_DOMAIN/api/auth/session` with no cookie and expects the API's
401, which proves the certificate and that Caddy sends the browser's `/api`
requests to the API. `SP_DEPLOY_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` names another origin, and a box
with no `APP_DOMAIN` in its `.env` skips this step. It gives up after `SP_DEPLOY_READY_SECONDS`, 180 by default. `doctor.sh`
runs the same check against the commit checked out on the box.

Only a deploy that passes is written down. It appends the time, the commit and
where its image came from to `/var/log/standardphysics-deploys.log` on the
Droplet. The last field is the registry digest that was pulled, or
`untested-local-build`. That file is the list of commits you can roll back to.
Lines written before this check existed were written before `doctor.sh` ran,
so an old line is not proof that deploy came up.

A deploy that never passes is left running so you can look at it. The script
prints what the check last saw, then the rollback command for the last commit
in the deploy log, runs `doctor.sh`, and exits with code 70:

```text
After 180 seconds the new stack is still not serving 0123abc…: http://127.0.0.1:8787/health/ready answered 503: {"status":"degraded",…}
To go back to 89ab…, the last deploy that came up:
  cd '/root/standardphysics' && git checkout 89ab… && cd deploy/digitalocean && GIT_SHA=89ab… docker compose up -d
```

On the Droplet itself it is the commands the script runs:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull
export GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
docker pull ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics:$GIT_SHA   # stop here if it fails
docker tag ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics:$GIT_SHA standardphysics:$GIT_SHA
# count the unfinished jobs, as above, and stop here if there are any
docker compose up -d
# repeat until it prints "serving", then append the line to the deploy log
docker compose exec -T api /opt/venv/bin/python - "$GIT_SHA" "https://$(grep ^APP_DOMAIN= .env | cut -d= -f2-)" < check_serving.py
```

## Rolling back

Every deploy leaves its image behind, tagged with its commit, so going back
to an earlier one reuses that image rather than building it again. On the
Droplet:

```bash
cat /var/log/standardphysics-deploys.log     # pick the commit to go back to
docker image ls standardphysics              # check its image is still here
cd /root/standardphysics
git checkout <sha>
cd deploy/digitalocean
GIT_SHA=<sha> docker compose up -d
curl -s https://api.standardphysics.app/health/details   # "commit" is now <sha>
```

Leave `--build` off. With it, compose rebuilds from the checked-out source,
which gives the same result far more slowly. Without it, compose finds
`standardphysics:<sha>` and starts it. If that image has been pruned, pull
it back first with
`docker pull ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics:<sha>` and
`docker tag ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics:<sha> standardphysics:<sha>`;
otherwise the command builds it from the checked-out commit instead. When the
deploy log recorded a digest, pulling `ghcr.io/imhaohao/standardphysics@<digest>`
gets exactly that image even if the tag were ever moved.

The checkout also rolls back `docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile` to that
commit, which is what you want: the image and the configuration it was
deployed with go back together.

The database is not rolled back with the code. Migrations only add tables,
columns and indexes (see [Schema migrations](#schema-migrations)), so an older
server runs on a newer database without noticing. If the release being undone
wrote data the older code cannot read, restore the database from the backup
taken before that release (below).

The next `scripts/deploy.sh` returns the box to master before it pulls, so
rolling forward again is an ordinary deploy.

Old images take a few GB each. Clear out the ones you will not roll back to
with `docker image rm standardphysics:<sha>`, keeping the last few.

## Schema migrations

The schema is `MIGRATIONS` in `services/api/standardphysics_api/db.py`, a
numbered list that starts at 1 and only grows at the end. When the API starts
it runs every version the database has not recorded, oldest first. Each one
runs in its own transaction and is recorded inside that transaction, so it
either finishes and is recorded or leaves no trace. If one fails, the start
stops with `Migration <version> (<name>) failed: ...`, and the database stays
at the version before it. Fix the migration and start again; the versions
that already ran are skipped.

Each database records what it has run in `schema_migrations`:

| Column | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | The migration's number, the primary key |
| `name` | What it adds, such as `add_owners_team` |
| `applied_at` | When it ran, in UTC |
| `detected` | 1 when the first versioned start found it already built instead of running it |

To see where the box is:

```bash
docker compose exec -T api /opt/venv/bin/python -c "
import sqlite3
rows = sqlite3.connect('/data/standardphysics.sqlite3').execute(
    'SELECT version, name, applied_at, detected FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version')
for row in rows: print(*row)"
```

Before this table existed, the server added any missing column on every
start. A database it built has tables but no `schema_migrations`. The first
start of the versioned server checks each migration's tables, columns and
indexes once, records the ones it finds with `detected = 1`, and runs only
what is missing. It never runs a detected version.

Migrations are additive. Never drop or rename a column in the same release
that stops using it. A rollback runs the previous image on the database the
newer one migrated, and the previous code still selects and inserts that
column. Stop using the column in one release, and drop it in a later one,
once no image you might roll back to reads it. Only add a column that has a
default or allows NULL, so the older code's inserts that leave it out still
succeed. A test in `services/api/tests/test_db_migration.py` fails if a
migration contains `DROP`, `RENAME`, `DELETE` or `UPDATE`.

To add one, append a migration with the next version number and run
`services/api/tests/test_db_migration.py`. Never edit or renumber a migration
that has shipped, since production has already recorded it and will not run it
again. A change that needs the server's settings or has to read today's rows,
like granting the team role from `SP_TEAM_EMAILS`, is a one-off step recorded
with `first_time` in `applied_steps` instead.

## One container holds the database

The database is SQLite on the volume and the worker claims jobs from it, so
the API is one container and stays one container. Two would be two workers
racing the same queue. Moving the store to Postgres is what lifts that, and
is worth doing when more than one person is scanning at a time.

## Backups

`deploy/digitalocean/backup.sh` takes one snapshot of everything on the
volume: the database, and the scans and keys beside it. Set where the
snapshots go in `.env`:

```bash
SP_BACKUP_DEST=/mnt/standardphysics-backups          # a path on this box
SP_BACKUP_DEST=backup@203.0.113.7:/srv/standardphysics   # or another box, over ssh
SP_BACKUP_KEEP=14
```

A local path should be on a second Block Storage volume, not the scans
volume, or the backup is lost with the thing it backs up. A remote target
needs rsync installed there and an ssh key on this box that works without a
passphrase. Spaces and other object stores are not supported, because
snapshots share unchanged files through hard links and an object store has
none.

Then turn on the nightly run, which `setup.sh` installed switched off:

```bash
systemctl enable --now standardphysics-backup.timer
systemctl start standardphysics-backup.service   # one now, to see it work
journalctl -u standardphysics-backup.service
```

How it works, and why:

- The database is copied with SQLite's online backup API, run by the API
  container's own Python. A plain file copy is not a backup here. The API
  keeps the database in WAL mode, where recent writes live in a separate
  `-wal` file until a checkpoint, so copying the main file alone can lose them.
- The volume is then copied with `rsync --link-dest` into a directory named
  for the UTC time, like `2026-09-27T103000Z`. A file that has not changed
  since the previous snapshot becomes a hard link to it, so each snapshot is a
  complete tree that costs only the space of what changed.
- The database goes first because an upload writes its file before it
  commits its row. Every artifact the database copy lists therefore already
  has its file on disk when rsync reads the volume. Copying the files first
  would miss the file of any upload that landed in between, and uploads are
  far more common than deletions.
- A deletion runs the other way round: the API commits the rows gone, then
  removes the files. A scan deleted after the database copy is still listed
  in the snapshot, with its files already gone. So after the copy, every
  listed artifact without a file is looked up in the live database. If its
  row has gone there too, it was deleted during the backup, and its name goes
  into `artifacts-deleted-during-backup.txt` in the snapshot, which
  `restore.sh` applies to the copy it restores. If its row is
  still there, the file is really missing: the backup keeps the snapshot,
  deletes no older one, since an older one may hold the only copy, names the
  files and exits 2, which fails the systemd unit.
- A snapshot is written as `<name>.partial` and renamed when it finishes, so
  a backup that dies halfway never looks like a good one.
- After a snapshot finishes, all but the newest `SP_BACKUP_KEEP` are deleted.
- One backup runs at a time, serialised with `flock` on
  `/var/lock/standardphysics-backup`. A second one, such as the timer
  catching up while a manual run is going, exits 75 without touching
  anything.

Run `backup.sh` by hand before anything risky, such as a rollback past a
release that changed stored data.

DigitalOcean's volume snapshots are still worth having as a floor, but they
catch SQLite mid-write, and `doctl compute volume-action snapshot` schedules
nothing on its own.

### Restoring

`restore.sh` copies a snapshot into a new directory and checks it. It never
writes over the live volume.

```bash
cd /root/standardphysics/deploy/digitalocean
./restore.sh                                 # lists the snapshots
./restore.sh latest /root/restored
```

It prints SQLite's integrity check, the number of scans, and the number of
artifacts the database lists against the number of files. Then it hashes
every listed artifact's file and compares it with the sha256 the database
recorded at upload. It exits 1 if the database is damaged, and 2 if some
listed artifact has no file (`missing file:`) or a file whose hash differs
(`corrupt file:`), naming each one.

A scan its owner deleted while the backup ran is finished off in the copy:
its rows go from every table with a `scan_id` column, the same set the API's
delete clears, and whatever of its files were copied go too. The restored
database then lists exactly the files it holds, with no exceptions to
explain away. A scan uploaded while the backup ran can show up as a file the
database does not list yet, which is harmless.

To put a checked copy back under the API:

```bash
docker compose stop api web
rsync -a /mnt/standardphysics-scans/ /mnt/standardphysics-backups/before-restore/
rsync -a --delete --exclude=/lost+found /root/restored/ /mnt/standardphysics-scans/
chown -R 10001:10001 /mnt/standardphysics-scans
docker compose start api web
```

The first copy keeps what was live, in case the restore was the mistake; put
it anywhere with room. `--delete` makes the volume hold exactly the restored
files, including removing the old `-wal` and `-shm` files, which belong to the
database being replaced. The volume stays mounted throughout, because it is a
mount point and moving it would move the mount.

## Alerts

`deploy/digitalocean/monitor.sh` runs every five minutes from a systemd
timer that `setup.sh` installs. It checks five things and posts a message to
`SP_ALERT_WEBHOOK` when one starts failing and again when it recovers:

| Check | Fails when | Threshold in `.env` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| readiness | `/health/ready` answers anything but 200, or cannot be reached | none |
| queue | `oldest_queued_job_seconds` in `/health/details` is over the limit | `SP_MONITOR_QUEUE_SECONDS=1800` |
| disk | the scans volume has less free space than the limit, measured with `df` | `SP_MONITOR_MIN_FREE_PERCENT=15` |
| system_disk | the Droplet's own disk, where Docker keeps its images, has less free space than the limit | `SP_MONITOR_SYSTEM_MIN_FREE_PERCENT=20` |
| backup | the newest snapshot in `SP_BACKUP_DEST` is older than the limit, or there is none, or `SP_BACKUP_DEST` is empty. `SP_BACKUPS_NOT_WANTED=1` skips it on a box whose data nobody needs back. | `SP_MONITOR_BACKUP_HOURS=26` |
| tracing | `WANDB_API_KEY` is set and `tracing` in `/health/details` says tracing is off, or counts a failed delivery | none |

It asks the API at `https://$API_DOMAIN` by default, through Caddy, so an
expired certificate or a stopped Caddy fails readiness too.
`SP_MONITOR_URL` points it somewhere else.

A message goes out only when the set of failing checks changes, so an outage
that lasts an hour sends one message when it starts and one when it ends,
not twelve. The failing set lives in
`/var/lib/standardphysics-monitor/failing`, and it is updated only after the
webhook accepts the message. If the webhook is down, the next run sends the
same news again.

`SP_ALERT_WEBHOOK` can be one of two kinds:

- **An ntfy topic.** Install the ntfy app on your phone, subscribe to a
  long, unguessable topic name, and set
  `SP_ALERT_WEBHOOK=https://ntfy.sh/<that topic>`. The message arrives as
  plain text with the title "Standard Physics monitor", at high priority
  when something started failing. Anyone who knows the topic name can read
  it, so pick a name nobody would guess. For a self-hosted ntfy server, set
  `SP_ALERT_FORMAT=ntfy` as well.
- **A generic JSON webhook.** Any other URL gets a POST of
  `{"text": "..."}` with `Content-Type: application/json`, which is what a
  Slack incoming webhook takes.

A message reads like this:

```
Standard Physics at https://api.standardphysics.app
Failing: readiness: https://api.standardphysics.app/health/ready answered 503
Failing: queue: the oldest queued job has waited 2400s, over the 1800s limit
```

Turn it on once the webhook is in `.env`, and run it once by hand:

```bash
systemctl enable --now standardphysics-monitor.timer
systemctl start standardphysics-monitor.service
journalctl -u standardphysics-monitor.service     # prints the failing checks, or "every check passes"
```

To see a real alert arrive, point `SP_MONITOR_URL` in `.env` at a URL that
answers 404, start the service, then put it back and start it again: that
sends one failure message and one recovery.

The monitor runs on the Droplet it watches, so it cannot report the Droplet
itself being off or unreachable. Add an outside check for that: a
DigitalOcean uptime check on `https://api.standardphysics.app/health`, with
its own email or Slack alert, takes a few minutes in the control panel.
`doctor.sh` reports whether alerts are on.

### What else is worth watching

These are the conditions worth a person's attention, including the ones the
monitor does not cover, what to poll for each, and whether `/health/details`
already answers it. Its body looks like this:

```json

| Condition | Alert when | Where to read it | In `/health/details` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Queue age | `oldest_queued_job_seconds` over 1800. A whole-floor bake runs about 15 minutes, so a job waiting twice that means the worker is stuck or far behind. | `/health/details` | Yes |
| Worker stall | `/health` answers 503 because a loop has died, or a loop's `state` is `stalled`, or a `busy` loop's `job.running_seconds` passes the longest bake you expect | `/health`, `/health/details` | Yes |
| Disk free | Under 15% or 5 GB free on the scans volume, or on the backup destination. Uploads and bakes write there, and SQLite fails every write once it is full. | `df -h /mnt/standardphysics-scans`, or the `space:` line of `doctor.sh` | No |
| Failed backup | The unit failed, or the newest snapshot is more than 26 hours old. `backup.sh` exits 2 when a file the live database lists is missing, and 75 when another backup was already running. | `systemctl is-failed standardphysics-backup.service`, `./restore.sh` with no arguments lists the snapshots | No |
| Failed deploy | `scripts/deploy.sh` exits non-zero: 75 means a job was still running after `SP_DEPLOY_DRAIN_SECONDS`, 69 means the queue could not be read or the drain could not be set, 66 means no tested image exists for the commit, anything else means the pull, build or restart failed. After a deploy, the `commit` in `/health/details` should match the last line of `/var/log/standardphysics-deploys.log`, which only records deploys that got as far as the restart. | the script's exit code, `/health/details` | The commit only |
| Tracing off | Only when `WANDB_PROJECT` is set on purpose and traces stop arriving. `tracing` in `/health/details` says whether tracing started and, when it did not, why, including a `weave.init` that ran past `SP_WEAVE_INIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (30 s). `delivery_errors` and `last_delivery_error` count the send failures the Weave SDK logged and any flush that raised or ran past `SP_WEAVE_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (15 s). Zero means none were logged, not that each trace arrived. | `/health/details`, the API log's `weave tracing is off` warning | Yes |

`monitor.sh` covers the queue age, a worker that has died, stalled or overrun
its deadline (through `/health/ready`), the scans volume's free space, the
backup's age and, when `WANDB_API_KEY` is set, tracing. It does not watch the
backup destination's disk or a failed deploy.

## Pointing the app at it

The iPhone app ships with both addresses compiled in, set in
`apps/ios/project.yml`:

```
CAPTURE_API_BASE_URL: https://api.standardphysics.app
CAPTURE_WORKSPACE_BASE_URL: https://standardphysics.app
```

The connection screen stays in the app for development, and an owner never has
to open it. `AppEnvironment` uses the compiled address whenever the build
carries one, and falls back to an address saved in `UserDefaults` only when
it does not, so a shipped build always talks to production however the phone
was pointed before.

## Updating the pinned Caddy image

Caddy is the only container that faces the internet, so the compose file pins it
by digest rather than by the moving `2-alpine` tag. To take a newer release, look
up the tag's current digest and replace the one in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker buildx imagetools inspect caddy:2-alpine --format '{{json .Manifest.Digest}}'
```

Then deploy as usual. The next `docker compose up -d` recreates only the Caddy
container, which drops open connections for about a second.

## Cost

| | |
|---|---|
| Droplet | 2 vCPU, 4 GB, Ubuntu 24.04 |
| Block Storage | 10 GB, grows with the shops |
| Domain | one, two records |
| Model calls | per scan |

DigitalOcean prices the first two and publishes current rates. Measure the
model calls yourself with `scripts/scan_cost.py`, which reads what OpenRouter
actually billed for one scan rather than estimating it.
