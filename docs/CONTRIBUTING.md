# Working on Standard Physics

How to run, change, test and deploy each part of the system. The [README](../README.md) is the short version for a reviewer.

## Start here

The team built the first version in four lanes, each with its own document under `docs/lanes/`, and several AI coding agents still follow that split. The lane documents and `docs/handoffs/` record how the work was divided and what each lane promised the others. For what the system does today, the code, the [README](../README.md) and [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md) are the current sources.

## Setup

You need Python 3.11 or newer and Node 20.9 or newer. From a fresh clone:

```bash
./start.sh
```

That installs the Python packages into `.venv` and the web packages into `apps/web`, then starts the API on port 8787 and the web workspace at http://localhost:3000. Ctrl-C stops both. For the demo, `./start.sh --prod` runs a production build instead.

Open the workspace and create an account. A scan belongs to the owner who uploaded it, and the list only ever shows your own shops, so a fresh account starts empty.

To start with a shop already in it, run `SP_SEED_SAMPLE_SHOP=1 ./start.sh`. That seeds the sample boba shop and the demo account that owns it, and logs the email to sign in as. Set `SP_SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD` to choose the password yourself; leave it unset and the server generates one and writes it to `demo-password` in the data directory (`services/api/var` unless `SP_DATA_DIR` says otherwise), readable only by you. The password only takes on the run that creates the account; later runs leave both the account and that file alone.

To load the phone scans in `datasets/phone`, run `.venv/bin/python scripts/import_scan.py datasets/phone/*` while it's running.

## Running the app on a phone

The server is hosted, so nothing has to be running on your Mac. A fresh clone
builds an app that already knows where to go.

```bash
open apps/ios/StandardPhysics.xcodeproj
```

Pick a phone with LiDAR (an iPhone 12 Pro or later Pro model, or a 2020 or
later iPad Pro), and run. There is no address to enter: `api.standardphysics.app`
and `standardphysics.app` are built in. Sign in with an account you make at
[standardphysics.app](https://standardphysics.app), walk a room, and the scan
uploads to the same server the workspace reads.

Running on a device needs you on the signing team in `apps/ios/project.yml`. The
simulator builds and signs without one, but it has no LiDAR and cannot scan;
`SIMULATOR_CAPTURE_DEMO=1` in the scheme's environment gets you past the
unsupported-device screen to look at everything else.

## Seeing a change

Most of what an owner looks at is the web workspace, including inside the app:
`WorkspaceScreen` opens `standardphysics.app/scans/<id>` in a web view. A web
change therefore reaches a phone already holding a TestFlight build as soon as
someone deploys, with no new build and no review.

| You changed | Look at it |
|---|---|
| The workspace, the report, sign-in | `npm run dev`, then `http://localhost:3000` |
| The same, on a phone | the same server at your Mac's address |
| Capture, upload, the native shell | Xcode, run on a device with LiDAR |
| A build you are about to hand someone | TestFlight |

TestFlight is for proving a build works and for giving it to people. Archive,
upload and processing is twenty minutes, which is no way to look at a change.

### On a phone, without deploying

`next dev` listens on every interface, so a phone on the same Wi-Fi can open
the workspace running on your Mac:

```bash
cd apps/web && npm run dev
ipconfig getifaddr en0     # the address to type on the phone
```

Then `http://<that address>:3000` in Safari. For the whole thing, API included,
`start.sh` says how at the top of the file.

### Without opening Xcode

```bash
scripts/run-ios.sh              # the connected phone, or the simulator
scripts/run-ios.sh --simulator  # always the simulator
```

The simulator has no LiDAR, so it cannot scan, and the run sets
`SIMULATOR_CAPTURE_DEMO=1` to get past the unsupported-device screen. Every
screen but the scan itself can be worked on there, which is most of them.

```bash
scripts/ship-ios.sh
```

Bumps the build number, archives, and uploads to TestFlight. It ships only a
clean checkout of a commit on origin/master whose CI and iOS runs both passed,
and appends the build number and commit to `apps/ios/testflight-builds.log`.
It needs an App Store Connect API key, which is what lets xcodebuild make the
distribution certificate on its own; the script says how to get one and where
to put it.

### Deploying

```bash
scripts/deploy.sh
```

From this repository on your own machine. It pulls master on the Droplet,
pulls the image CI tested for that commit, restarts, and checks the result;
it builds on the Droplet only with `SP_DEPLOY_BUILD=1`.
[`docs/DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md) has the rest.

### Pointing the app at your own machine

An address built into the app beats a saved one, so the connection screen no
longer overrides it, and a release build does not offer that screen at all. To
work against a server you are running yourself, set both addresses in the
scheme's environment, which beats the built-in pair:

    Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme > Run > Arguments > Environment Variables

        API_BASE_URL        http://<your Mac's network address>:8787
        WORKSPACE_BASE_URL  http://<your Mac's network address>:3000

Use the Mac's address on the network rather than `localhost`, which on a phone
means the phone. Plain HTTP is accepted only for a local address; anything else
has to be HTTPS.

Findings come only from rules whose threshold has been checked against the text it cites. `scripts/verify_rulepack.py` does that check and writes the ledger, which is committed, so a clean clone reports findings without any flag. Two rules are left off it and the script says why for each. A person who has read a section adds their name with `.venv/bin/standardphysics-agents rules second-check <rule> --by "<name>"`. `SP_PREVIEW_UNVERIFIED_RULES=1` runs every rule including the two, for development only, and stamps the report as unreviewed.

To run the tests and the linter:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/python -m pytest packages/agents services/api/tests -q
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
(cd apps/web && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test)
```

To ask how many of something is in a scan:

```bash
.venv/bin/standardphysics-agents count books --scan services/api/var/scans/<id>
```

Every measured region has sides with a measured area. Each side is cut into patches of a known size, each patch is projected into the frame that photographed it most squarely, and a model is asked one question about each crop: how many of the named thing can you see here. The engine does the rest, so the density, the multiplication and the coverage are arithmetic over measurements and no figure in the answer came out of a sentence.

Nothing in the code matches the word you type. Ask for chairs and the shelving returns nothing; ask for books and the desks do. It follows that the answer covers only the surface a walk actually photographed, and the report says how much that was and what share was never seen.

`--patch` sets the patch size in metres, `--readings` how many times each patch is counted before taking the median, and `--workers` how many run at once. It needs `DISCOVERY_API_KEY`, `DISCOVERY_BASE_URL` and `DISCOVERY_MODEL` set, and refuses to run rather than guessing without them.

To score the app on rooms it was not built against:

```bash
.venv/bin/standardphysics-agents held-out --seed 21
```

That writes fresh questions about a scanned room, asks them, and scores each answer against the room rather than against an expected string. It then does the whole thing again over the same geometry with every name replaced by a nonsense token, and prints what the names were worth. A gap between the two is something answering from an English word instead of from a measurement.

Around one question in eight has no answer in the scan. Saying so scores as a pass and answering it anyway scores as a failure, which is the part a system that games the rest fails hardest.

It needs real scans and refuses to run without them, and it needs a model to write and judge. `--questions` sets how many per room (80 for a full run, fewer for a look), `--hold-out` how many rooms are scored on, and `--model`, `--base-url` and `--api-key-env` point it at an endpoint other than the configured one:

```bash
.venv/bin/standardphysics-agents held-out --seed 21 --questions 12 \
  --model accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k3 \
  --base-url https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1 --api-key-env FIREWORKS_API_KEY
```

To move the shop's dimensions by hand and watch the same checks read the new room:

```bash
.venv/bin/marimo edit notebooks/scenario_sweep.py
```

That is a marimo notebook, installed by `./start.sh`. [`docs/marimo.md`](marimo.md) says what each slider does.

Lane B additionally needs Blender 5.x. `brew install --cask --force blender` — the `--force` matters, because a plain install silently does nothing when Blender was installed by hand.

## Deploying it

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That builds one image and runs two containers from it, the API and the web workspace, with the scans in a named volume. Open http://localhost:3000. Add `SP_SEED_SAMPLE_SHOP=1` to the environment to seed the sample shop and its demo account.

On a host that gives you a single container and a single port, run the same image with no argument. The entrypoint then serves the workspace on `$PORT` and runs the API beside it on 8787:

```bash
docker build -t standardphysics .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v scans:/data standardphysics
```

The scans and every uploaded artifact live in `/data`. Mount it, or a restart loses every shop anyone has scanned.

`/health` answers without a session, so a load balancer can ask. It reads from the database, because a process that is listening but cannot read its own scans is not healthy in any way that matters.

The image installs a pinned Blender (see the `Dockerfile`), which bakes the painted scan and renders the picture beside each finding. The pitch deck at `/present` is public. The drafting sandbox at `/brush` is not part of the product, so it answers 404 unless `SP_SHOW_DEMO_ROUTES=1` asks for it.

## What already works

Every lane can start right now without waiting on another.

**`packages/contracts/`** holds the types everyone shares: `SceneGraph`, `Finding`, `Locus`, `Proposal`, `Assessment`, and the `MeasurementProvider` protocol that joins Lane B to Lane C. Lane D owns this package; everyone else reads it.

**`packages/fixtures/`** holds a synthetic boba shop. Two display cases run in from the side walls and leave exactly 31 inches between them, on the only path from the door to the counter. Moving one case 5 inches opens it to the 36 inches the standard requires, so the whole find-then-fix loop is testable before any real scan exists.

```python
from standardphysics_fixtures import FixtureMeasurements, build_graph, build_scenario

result = FixtureMeasurements().route_clear_width(build_graph(), build_scenario(), 0)
result.inches          # 31.0
result.pinch_point     # where the camera should fly to
```

`FixtureMeasurements` implements `MeasurementProvider`, so Lane C writes checks against it today and swaps in Lane B's real implementation later by changing one constructor argument.

**`services/api/openapi.json`** is the upload contract. Lane A codes against it, Lane D implements it, and it runs locally right now:

```bash
python -m standardphysics_fixtures.mock_api    # :8787
```

**`packages/fixtures/standardphysics_fixtures/data/`** holds `shop.scene_graph.json`, `shop.usdz`, and `shop.node_map.json`.

That last file matters more than it looks. USD prim names must be alphanumeric with underscores and cannot start with a digit, so a UUID cannot be one — export it as a name and the hyphens vanish, the names collide, and every object comes back as `Cube_001`. Prims are named `n_<uuid hex>` and the map carries them home. RoomPlan solves the same problem with its `metadataURL` mapping file, which is why Lane A has to capture it.
