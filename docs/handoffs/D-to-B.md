# D to B: walls seal their doorways

## A route cannot pass through a door

`build_grid` leaves doors out of the grid, which is right. Nothing removes the
door from the wall it sits in, though, so the wall stays solid across the
opening. RoomPlan reports a wall at its full length and puts each door inside
it as a separate surface.

Reproduced at `28e64c1` on the fixture shop:

- The front door is 0.90 m wide at (0.00, -4.00), and the south wall runs 6 m
  along the same line.
- 17 of 17 samples taken 5 cm apart across the door opening are occupied, and
  the wall owns every one.
- A stop 1 m outside the door has no route to the counter.
  `route_clear_width` returns `reachable=False` with no blockers.

The tests pass only because the fixture's Entrance stop sits 0.3 m inside the
room, so no leg ever crosses the door. On a real scan, any route that starts
outside or leads into a back room fails. It either comes back unreachable, or
`_nearest_free` snaps the stop to the other side of the wall.

**Suggested fix:** mark the walls, then clear every cell that a `door` or
`opening` footprint covers. `door_clear_width` and the 404.2.4 maneuvering
check will need the opening as open floor anyway.

`build_street_scenario()` in `standardphysics_fixtures` is coming in my next
push. Its entrance stop sits 1 m outside the front door, so a regression test
can cross the doorway.

## Fixture scenario: legs 2 and 3 change, leg 0 does not

- **Seat moves.** It sits at (-2.0, -2.4), which is the centre of table_3. On
  the current code, leg 3 measures 6.89 in because the route starts inside a
  table. Seat moves to open floor beside that table. Every test in `tests/`
  uses leg 0 only.
- **Stops get anchors.** Each stop gains the `anchor_node_id` the audit asked
  for in A-6. Entrance and Exit anchor to the front wall, Counter and Pickup to
  the counter, and Seat to table_3. Nothing in your code changes until you read
  the field.

Leg 1, from Counter to Pickup, measures 29.79 in between two stops that stand
0.15 m from the counter face. Please check whether that number is the endpoint
exemption or a real pinch.

## Contract fields landing next

Both are optional, and their defaults keep today's behaviour:

- `Stop.anchor_node_id: UUID | None = None` (audit A-6)
- `WidthResult.needs_measurement: bool = False` (audit A-9)

`standardphysics_contracts.graph_hash(graph)` is coming too. Use it wherever a
graph hash is needed, so a hash computed in one lane matches another lane's.

## One ask: clearance along a route

The viewer should colour a `path` annotation by the clearance at each point.
`Annotation.points` has no values for that. If `widest_path` can return the
clearance in inches at each point, I will add an optional per-point field to
`Annotation`. Tell me whether that is cheap on your side.

## Update: shorter display cases, a rebuilt GLB, and `point_inches`

- **Display cases.** Each case now stops 6 inches short of its side wall
  (`CASE_WALL_GAP_INCHES`), so Lane C's documented 5 inch fix is a legal move.
  The aisle is still exactly 31 in, and the fix still reaches 36.
- **Two of your tests.** Both sealed the aisle by widening `case_east` until it
  met `case_west`, which now leaves a 6 in route past the wall. Each test now
  stretches `case_east` wall to wall instead, and checks the same thing:
  - `tests/test_measure.py::test_a_blocked_route_reports_unreachable`
  - `tests/test_audit_lane_b.py::test_a7_resizing_an_object_rebuilds_the_cached_grid`
- **Rebuilt files.** `shop.glb` and `shop.usdz` are rebuilt from the new graph
  with Blender 5.2.1.
- **`point_inches`.** `Annotation.point_inches: list[float | None] | None` is
  in. Please return `None` for points inside the exemption, as you offered. The
  viewer will then colour only the values that mean something.

## Urgent: on a real scan the floor is not at z = 0

`packages/fixtures/standardphysics_fixtures/data/real/` now holds two real
RoomPlan exports from Apple's WWDC23 sample (MIT-style licence, notice
included). Each has `room.json`, the mapping file and the USDZ. `parse_room_json`
reads all 11 rooms in that sample without an error.

RoomPlan puts the origin wherever the phone started, so the floor of a real
scan sits about 1.4 m below z = 0. `blocks_floor` compares an object's top
against `BLOCKING_HEIGHT` in absolute z, which gets both directions wrong. In
`apple_livingroom.room.json` the floor is at z = -1.436:

| Object | Bottom | Top | `blocks_floor` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sofa (3 of them) | -1.436 | -0.558 | **False** |
| Table (2) | -1.436 | -0.974 / -0.927 | **False** |
| Oven | -1.436 | -0.546 | **False** |
| Television, wall-mounted | -0.224 | +0.620 | **True** |
| Storage, wall-mounted | -0.463 | +0.979 | **True** |

So every sofa and table reads as open floor, and a wall-mounted cabinet whose
underside is 0.97 m up reads as a floor obstruction. Counter height, camera
eye height and render framing all assume the same floor.

**Suggested fix:** in ingest, shift every node so the floor's z is 0, then let
nothing else change. Measure a blocker by its bottom as well as its top, so an
object whose underside clears 27 in stays out of the floor grid and belongs to
the protruding-objects check instead.

Two other things the real files settle for you:

- **`parentIdentifier`.** Every door, window and opening carries its parent
  wall's identifier. Reading it into `SceneNode.parent_id` tells the doorway
  carve-out exactly which wall to cut.
- **The mapping file is a binary plist** (`bplist00`), not JSON, even though
  Lane A names it `room.metadata.json`. Read it with `plistlib.loads`.
  `usdz_to_glb` should accept both.
- **Unknown top-level keys.** Real exports carry `coreModel` (a base64 blob,
  60-90% of the file), `sections`, `story` and `version`. Newer ones also carry
  `referenceOriginTransform`. None has a top-level `identifier`.

`tests/test_real_exports.py` pins what already works.

## `usdz_to_glb` on a real export: the mapping is a plist

The API now runs your stages on uploads. I replayed Apple's real living room
(`data/real/apple_livingroom.*`) through upload, finalize and the job queue with
Blender 5.2.1:

- `parse_room_json` produced the graph, and the scan was ready in about 2
  seconds.
- `usdz_to_glb` opened the USDZ, taking 35 ms, but printed no `USDZ_CONVERTED`.
  `load_map` calls `json.loads` on the mapping file, and a real mapping is a
  binary plist. Try `plistlib.loads` first and fall back to JSON. The API names
  the file `room.metadata.plist` when its bytes start with `bplist`, and
  `room.metadata.json` otherwise.
- The API fell back to `export_glb`, which named all 22 GLB nodes by SceneGraph
  ID.

## A finding at 0.0 inches on the sample shop

With every rule verified for preview, the fixture reports "The turn around the
display case is too tight" measured at **0.0 in**. The aisle and counter
findings read 31.0, 29.79 and 43.3 as expected. A 0.0 in turn looks like
`turn_detail` returning an unmeasured zone as zero. Lane C sees it too.

---

## `0f0e01b` broke Lane C's turn check

Returning `None` for an unmeasured turn zone is right. Lane C's
`turn_verdict` still compares each zone with `<`, so `assess` now raises on
the fixture shop, and CI on `0f0e01b` is red. Details are in `D-to-C.md`.
Please agree the fix with Lane C before either of you pushes it.

---

## A drag re-check takes about 2 s, and the target is under 1 s

Dragging furniture calls `assess` on every drop, through
`POST /api/scans/{id}/layout-checks`. On the fixture shop, with every rule
enabled, one call takes 1.7 to 2.3 s. The profile of one call on a moved
layout:

| Where | Calls | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `routes.widest_path` | **20** | 3.86 s of 4.26 s under cProfile |
| `occupancy.Grid.contains` | 4,535,305 | 0.81 s |
| `measure.route_clear_width` | 16 | 3.26 s |

The same four legs get routed again for route width, turn detail, run length,
passing space and exit path, all on the same layout. Caching the widest path
per graph hash and leg inside `PipelineMeasurements` would drop that to 4
routes. Moving the bounds check out of the Python loop would speed up each
route as well.

---

## The counter-height render and camera are too close to read

The printed report (`/scans/<id>/report`) now shows your `render_finding`
stills, and the viewer flies to each locus camera. For "The ordering counter is
too high to order from", both show a flat close-up of the counter front with
the vertical line and nothing else. Nobody can tell what they are looking at.
The route renders read well. Pulling the height camera back to show the counter
against the floor and a nearby table would fix both views.

---

## The counter leads the demo now, at 47 inches

The pitch example is a real lawsuit, Whitaker v. T Rock Inc. (N.D. Cal. No.
5:22-cv-00283). Its complaint, paragraph 12, puts the ordering counter at about
47 inches, against the 36 in that ADA 2010 904.4.1 allows. The fixture counter
now stands exactly 47 in, up from 43.3 in. The route pinch is unchanged, and
`shop.glb` and `shop.usdz` are rebuilt. Your tests read the height from the
graph, so they still pass.

That makes the counter height the first finding people see. **The height
locus camera matters most now.** Today it frames a flat close-up of the counter
front with a vertical line, in both the viewer and `render_finding`. The shot
needs to show:

- the counter against the floor
- the 47 in line running up its front
- enough of the room to read as a shop

The deck in `apps/web` draws a 36 in long lowered section next to it, so leave
a little room at one end of the counter.
