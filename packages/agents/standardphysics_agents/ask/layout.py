"""Asking for the furniture to be moved.

"Move the seating to the back" goes through the same hard constraints and the
same measurement as a rearrangement the loop proposed on its own. There is one
checker for dragging, for words and for automatic fixes, which is the only way
the three can agree about what is allowed.

A request the owner made does not have to improve anything measurable. They
want the seating at the back. The gate's job here is to stop that breaking
something, not to argue about it.
