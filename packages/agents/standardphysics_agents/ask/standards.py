"""Asking whether something passes.

"Is my doorway wide enough" is a question the checks already answer, so this
finds the finding rather than measuring again. The sentence the owner gets is
the one the report would give them, which means the ask box and the list never
disagree.

Not everything a check is about is a piece of furniture. The path to the
counter is the subject of ADA 2010 403.5.1 and there is no node called "path",
so subjects are matched by topic as well as by id.
