"""The ask box: any question about the shop, answered from the measured model.

One entry point, a closed set of question kinds, and one executor each. The
model reads the sentence and picks the kind. Every number in the answer is read
off the room or taken by the measurement provider, so an answer can be wrong
about what was asked and never wrong about what is there.

Each answer carries a locus, so asking about the tables sends the camera to the
tables. That is the difference between a room you can talk to and a list of
measurements.
