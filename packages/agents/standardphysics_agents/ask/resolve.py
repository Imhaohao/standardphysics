"""Working out which question was asked.

The model does this job because it is the one thing in the app that needs
judgment about language: "how would you describe my table arrangement" and
"what shape are my tables in" are the same question, and no amount of keyword
matching gets there. What the model returns is a kind and its arguments, never
a fact about the shop.

The keyword resolver underneath it is a fallback, labelled as one, so the
feature works in a demo with no key and nobody is misled about which answered.
