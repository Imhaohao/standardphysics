"""Contract 4 limit comparisons, bound to the legal rules.

The pipeline's `primitives.uncertainty` holds the arithmetic: unknown bounds
never pass, intervals that straddle a limit need verification, and only a
supported bound on the right side of the limit can conclude. This module is
the rules' side of that contract: it translates a `RuleSpec` into the head and
comparison the section states, converts units exactly and visibly, and returns
the same three verdicts an assessment row can carry.

Nothing here guesses an uncertainty. A caller without bounds must pass the
pipeline's `unknown_bounds`, and the answer will be needs_verification, which
is the honest reading of "we measured it but we have no stated accuracy".
