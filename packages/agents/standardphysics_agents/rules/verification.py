"""A check is enabled by a person, not by an agent.

An entry here records that someone read the section and confirmed the number.
It binds the rule id, the section, the threshold and the unit together, so
editing a threshold in the rule pack invalidates its verification and the check
switches itself off. That is the enforcement behind "no agent changes a
threshold": there is no edit an agent can make that both moves a number and
keeps the check running.
