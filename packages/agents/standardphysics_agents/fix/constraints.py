"""What a rearrangement is not allowed to do.

Plan section 10 names the hard constraints: walls, built-in counters, doors and
their swing, the floor boundary, confirmed sizes, owner locks, and the checks
themselves. The checks are enforced by re-running them. Everything else is
enforced here, before a candidate is measured at all, because a candidate that
puts a display case inside a wall has an excellent clear width and is not a
rearrangement anybody can carry out.

Two more keep a candidate honest about what it is for. A piece may not travel
far from where the scan found it, and a table or counter has to keep room for
somebody to pull up to it. Without them a table shoved flush into a corner
widens the aisle beside it, the checks see an improvement, and nobody can sit
at the table.

A piece also may not be set down on floor the scan never saw. The floor
outline RoomPlan reports runs into corners the phone never pointed at, and a
layout that parks a case there has been checked against floor nobody measured.

part of the room, which is a redesign for the owner to choose rather than a
fix, and it lands on floor the scan only ever saw around something else.

It is measured from `SceneNode.measured_position`, which every move carries
forward, so a run of small moves across rounds or saved revisions adds up
against it exactly as one long move would.

A chair set flush against a wall loses a 25 mm strip along one side, about 6

the unseen-floor check does not run, rather than failing every move: nothing
in such a graph says which floor was seen, so refusing everything would stop
all rearranging of every older scan while telling nobody anything new. This
is not a compliance outcome, so the rule that an unknown never becomes a pass
does not reach it. The checks still measure the layout that comes out, the
floor outline and `MAX_TRAVEL_METERS` still bound where a piece can go, and a
simulation says so in its limitations.
