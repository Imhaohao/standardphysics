"""What a rearrangement is not allowed to do.

Plan section 10 names the hard constraints: walls, built-in counters, doors and
their swing, the floor boundary, confirmed sizes, owner locks, and the checks
themselves. The checks are enforced by re-running them. Everything else is
enforced here, before a candidate is measured at all, because a candidate that
puts a display case inside a wall has an excellent clear width and is not a
rearrangement anybody can carry out.
