"""A measured approach to a target, for deciding what furniture could improve it.

The approach is one journey by one occupant body: from a confirmed start, along
the same route and swept-collision machinery the assessment already uses, to a
standing point beside the target, then the turn to face it and the personal
reach to it. Everything missing stays missing: a blocked path, an unknown
floor, an unmeasured height or a hidden reach is reported, never argued away.

Outcomes are `clear`, `blocked` and `needs_verification`. `clear` requires
every measured input to be present and to pass for every occupant profile
asked about. There is no code path that turns a missing measurement into a
passing approach by dropping a constraint.

Thin wall attachments are not solid obstacles: the surface that carries the
target (the wall or bench the outlet sits in) is exempt from the direct
obstruction line between the standing point and the target, and from nothing
else. Furniture standing between occupant and target still blocks.
