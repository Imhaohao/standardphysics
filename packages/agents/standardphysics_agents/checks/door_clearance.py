"""ADA 2010 404.2.4. Room to work the door once you get to it.

Table 404.2.4.1 has twelve rows, and which one applies depends on the approach
direction and on which way the door opens. A scan gives the doorway and the
route gives the approach. Neither gives the swing: nothing in a measured room
says whether a door is pulled or pushed from inside.

So this measures the patch of floor on the approach side once and reads the
table from the stricter end. Clear to the pull depth and it complies whichever
way the door opens. Short of the push depth and it fails either way. In between
it depends on the swing, which makes it a question for the owner rather than a
finding, because a check that guessed would be citing a row of the table
nobody established.
