"""Whether a named patch of floor is clear.

Several sections ask about a rectangle rather than a circle: 305.3's clear
floor space, 404.2.4's maneuvering clearance at a door. `MeasurementProvider`
answers circles through `turning_space` and one particular rectangle through
`counter_approach`, so this composes Lane B's published footprint helpers into
the general question.

Asked for as `clear_floor` in docs/handoffs/C-to-B.md. It belongs beside the
other measurements and this goes when it lands.

`gap_between` reads touching and overlapping the same way, and a patch of

clearance. 5 mm is a fifth of an inch, well under anything a scan resolves.
