"""ADA 2010 904.4.1, the clear floor space 305.3 it refers to, and the register.

Two numbers on the counter itself: how high it is, and whether there is room
to pull up alongside it. A third when a lowered section already exists: whether
people actually pay there. 904.4.1 is met by providing the portion. The
complaint in the pitch is that the point of sale still sat on the high part.
