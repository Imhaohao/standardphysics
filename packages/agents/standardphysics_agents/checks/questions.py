"""The things LiDAR cannot see, turned into one specific ask each.

A scan measures shapes. It does not measure how hard a door is to push, what a
handle feels like in a closed fist, whether the mat by the door is stuck down,
or which of the boxes on a wall is a light switch. Each of those becomes a
single request for one piece of evidence, written as the thing to do rather
than as the thing we are missing.
