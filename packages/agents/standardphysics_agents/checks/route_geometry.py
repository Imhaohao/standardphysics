"""Reading the shape of a route out of the stops it visits.

Two rules only apply in particular places: 403.5.2 at a 180 degree turn, and
304.3 where somebody has to turn around. Both need to know where the route
doubles back, which is a question about the route and not about any rule.

It is answered from the stops rather than from the measured path on purpose. A
path on a 25 mm grid detours around whatever is in the way, so the first half
metre of the leg out of a tight counter slot runs back the way the customer
came in. That makes every narrow approach look like a dead end. Net travel
between one stop and the next does not have that problem: a dead end is a place
you leave in the direction you arrived from, and that is a fact about the stops.
