"""ADA 2010 304.3. Room to turn around where the route doubles back.

304 is scoped by the sections that call for it rather than applying everywhere,
so this runs at dead ends: a stop the customer has to reverse out of. Turning
around in the middle of an open floor is not a requirement and reporting it as
one would put a card in front of the owner that no section backs.
