"""What a check measured, before it becomes a sentence.

A check answers a geometric question and says which rule it answered it
against. Turning that into a title, a measurement line and a fix happens in
copy.py, and deciding whether it is a problem or a request happens in
findings.py. Keeping those apart means a check never has to know how it reads.
