"""A menu of legal moves: the model picks from options code has already checked and measured.

Asked for raw `{"moves":[{"node_id","dx","dy","rotation_degrees"}]}`, the base
model had 57-77% of its answers refused for collisions or leaving the floor on
square rooms, and on rotated rooms it mostly answered with no moves at all.
Models that write coordinates fail this way; systems that never place anything
illegally let code own the geometry. So the model here chooses, and code places.

1. Generate. For each fixable problem, the solver's own guesses: the slide
   ladder of `fix/strategies.py` and the placement beam of `fix/placement.py`,
   and slides that set a too-high item down on a lower surface
   (`fix/surfaces.py`). When none of those clears the problem, three more
   families get their own tries: every piece inside a turning circle pushed
   out at once (`fix/clearing.py`), a table carried together with its seats
   (`fix/groups.py`), and short nudges of each named piece along its own sides
   (`fix/nudges.py`). Last come short slides of a built-in fixture the problem
   names, alone or together with the built-ins it touches (`fix/built_ins.py`),
   so a counter keeps its lowered section. Each is worded as a relation
   ("slide Chair [3f2a] 14 in away from the Cafe table, for P1").
   After Holodeck (Yang et al., CVPR 2024, arXiv:2312.09067), where the language
   model states relations and a solver enforces no-collision and in-bounds.
2. Mask. Only guesses `reward.constrained` finds nothing wrong with survive:
   `fix.violations`, `relocation_violations` for a relocated fixture, and the
   veto of any ADA layout directive for the room's space type, the same test
   that refuses an answer. An illegal move can never be offered.
   After invalid action masking (Huang & Ontanon, FLAIRS 2022, arXiv:2006.14171).
3. Measure. The training checker runs on every survivor, and each option is
   labelled with what it clears, what it improves (before -> after inches),
   any new problem, usability, and inches moved. Options the gate would refuse
   are left off. After SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022, arXiv:2204.01691), which
   combines the language model's choice with a feasibility score.
4. Resolve. The model answers `{"choose":[3,7],"why":"..."}`. Picks apply in
   order, and a pick that has become illegal after earlier ones, or moves a
   piece an earlier pick already moved, is dropped and reported, so the room
   applied is always legal. A free-form `{"moves":[...]}` answer is snapped to
   legal floor by `fix/snap.py` instead of being refused.

Each turn is stateless: the prompt is the current room, the menu and the last
result, never the whole conversation.
