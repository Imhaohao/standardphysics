"""What the owner wants kept, read from where things already stand or told to us directly.

A shop's layout is the owner's own work. Chairs sit at a table because people
eat there, shelving stands against a wall because that is where the owner put
it, and the counter looks out over the floor so staff can see customers. A fix
that clears an accessibility problem by breaking one of those is a fix the
owner will undo. So each relation becomes a `Wish` that any proposed room can
be checked against.

Inferred wishes come from the layout itself (`infer_wishes`): a seat stays at
its table, a piece that stands against a wall stays against one, and the view
from the counter stays clear. The relations are the ones `quality.py` already
scores, turned into yes-or-no checks with a stated tolerance.

Stated wishes come from the owner (`stays_put`, `stays_near`, and `not_there`
for a spot they turned down). They are hard:
an option that breaks one is never offered. Inferred wishes are soft, because
they are a guess about what the owner meant.
