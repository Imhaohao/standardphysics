"""The owner in the loop: they see each change before it is kept, and say yes, no, or what to keep.

A proposal the checker accepts still goes to the owner. When they turn it
down they usually say why ("keep the chairs at that table"), and what they say
becomes a stated wish that every later option is held to. `WishBook` keeps
each wish with the layout it was read from or said about, since a wish like
"stays at the table" means "as it was in that layout".

`SimulatedOwner` stands in for a real owner in evaluation and training. Their
wishes are the relations in their own layout before any scramble
(`infer_wishes(owner_layout)`), which the model never sees directly. They
object only to a change that newly breaks one of those wishes, so a room the
scramble already disturbed is not held against the model. `InteractiveOwner`
asks a person at the terminal instead.
