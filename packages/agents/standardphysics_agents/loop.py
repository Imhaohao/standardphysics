"""One trip round the loop, with the router's answer choosing the branch.

The point of this file is that the action is not advice. `FIX` runs the search
and can change the layout. `RESCAN_AREA` asks for more scan. `ASK_OWNER` puts a
question in front of a person. `ESCALATE` queues something for a professional.
`DONE` ends the report. There is one handler per action and no default, so an
answer that does not validate reaches no handler and the layout, the questions
and the report are exactly as they were.

A `FIX` does not get to change anything on its own either. The rearrangement it
produces is measured again and put through the gate, and the layout only moves
if the gate accepts it.

Each run is one conversation in Weave's Agents tab and each pass is one turn,
with a tool span for the assessment, the search, the gate and every other
branch. The spans hold counts and verdicts, never the scene graph.
