"""The labelled cases the checks are scored against.

A case says what a correct answer looks like, and it says so from the standard
rather than from what the code currently returns. Where the two disagree, one
of them is wrong and the point of the dataset is to make that visible. It has
already earned its keep twice: it caught a turn reported as zero inches wide
where there was no route either side of it to measure, and the same corner
reported twice on an out-and-back errand.

Almost every case starts from `_base()`, which removes the seating by the
counter to isolate the geometry each case varies. The shipped shop's route
passes through open floor beside that seating; the diagonal distance from a
table to the counter is not a corridor width. `fixture_as_shipped` retains
all furniture and expects one deduplicated aisle pinch and the high counter.

Every case carries the five things a scan cannot see, because those are asked
of every shop. What varies is the geometry, the labels, how sure we are of
them, and what the loop should do next.

`actions_taken` is how a case reaches a later stage of the loop. The router
never escalates before it has asked, so a case that should escalate has to say
that asking already happened.
