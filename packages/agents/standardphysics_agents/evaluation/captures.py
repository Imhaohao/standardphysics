"""Real RoomPlan captures, through the same evaluator.

`scenarios.py` builds a room out of knobs, so a slider can move one dimension
while everything else holds still. This is the other end of the same idea: the
room is a capture off a phone, the geometry is whatever the scan found, and
what there is to control is the trip somebody takes through it and where the
furniture stands.

Nothing here is scored. A capture carries no labels, so there is no correct
measurement to read an answer against, and `measurement_error_in` on a room
nobody measured by hand would report the distance to a number that was never
written down. What a capture shows instead is what the checks say about
geometry that was measured rather than authored, and how much of that answer
the scan's own confidence withholds.

Rearranging goes through `fix.moves.apply_moves` and is judged by
`fix.constraints`, the pair the fix agent already uses, so a nudge here can
only be a move the loop was allowed to propose: movable furniture, translated
along the floor, never resized.
