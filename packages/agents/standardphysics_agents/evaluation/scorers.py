"""How a case is scored.

Every scorer returns `None` when the case has nothing to say about it, and the
runner leaves those out of the mean rather than counting them as zero. A shop
with no doorway should not drag down door accuracy.

`measurement_error_in` is an error, not a score. Lower is better, and the gate
reads it that way.
