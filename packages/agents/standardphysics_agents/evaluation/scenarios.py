"""One room and one routine, built from knobs, run through the same evaluator.

The labelled cases in `dataset.py` fix their geometry, because a score only
means the same thing twice if the room did not move between readings. This is
the other way round: the room is whatever the knobs say, and the point is to
watch a check change its mind while one knob moves.

Nothing here scores a room. `run_knobs` builds a `Case` and hands it to
`run_case`, the same function the Weave evaluation and the W&B grid call, so a
finding seen while dragging a slider is the finding the server would report for
that room.

A knob that sets a dimension also says what a correct measurement of it is.
Setting the aisle to 31 in means the tightest leg of a route that starts inside
the door should come back at 31 in, and `measurement_error_in` reads it that
way. Where a knob stops pinning a dimension it claims nothing: walking in from
the street puts the doorway on the route, so the aisle is no longer the
tightest thing on it and the route carries no expected measurement.
