"""Running the dataset, and keeping the per-case results.

The local JSON is the authoritative record, because it exists whether or not
anybody has a W&B account and CI has none. When Weave is configured the run is
also logged to Weave's Evals tab, one prediction per case with every score,
labelled with the router that answered. Two routers scored on the same cases
then sit side by side there, next to the traces.

A case that raises does not take the run down. It is recorded as a failure and
the run is marked incomplete, which is what the gate reads: an evaluation that
did not complete cannot accept anything.
