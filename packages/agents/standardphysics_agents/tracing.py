"""Weave tracing that survives having no account.

`@traced` goes on every check and every agent call. Once `init()` has run, each
call shows up in the trace tree; until then the decorator costs one attribute
read. Nothing in this lane may require a third-party account in order to run,
because the tests run in CI and CI has no keys.

The loop also reports itself to Weave's Agents tab: one conversation per run,
one turn per pass, a tool span for each thing a pass does and a chat span for
each model call. `start_conversation`, `start_turn`, `start_tool` and
`start_llm` wrap the SDK calls of the same names. With tracing off, or no
conversation open, each yields an `Unrecorded` that accepts the same writes and
keeps none of them.
