"""Where staff work, so the customer checks leave it alone.

Nothing in a scan says which floor is the kitchen. The usual shop puts it
behind the service counter, on the side away from the front door, so that is
the guess: the floor from the counter's back face to the walls behind it, as
wide as the room. The owner moves or removes it; once they have, their answer
is the scenario's and the guess is never made again.
