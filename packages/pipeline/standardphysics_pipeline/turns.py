"""Finding 180 degree turns in a route, and measuring the three widths one needs.

ADA 2010 403.5.2 asks for more than a single number. Where a route turns 180
degrees around an element narrower than 48 inches, it wants 42 inches
approaching the turn, 48 at the turn, and 42 leaving it. The exception is that
none of it applies when the turn itself is 60 inches or wider.

So a turn has three measurements and a question about the thing being walked
around, and `route_clear_width` cannot express any of that.

**Where this approximates.** The rule says "an element which is less than 48
inches wide" without saying which of its dimensions counts. We report the
pivot's smaller horizontal extent, which is the conservative reading: it treats
more turns as in scope rather than fewer. Person C confirms the pivot and the
reading before a finding goes out.
