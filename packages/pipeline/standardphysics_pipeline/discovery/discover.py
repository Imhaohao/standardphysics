"""Finding the objects the scan measured but never named.

RoomPlan boxes the categories Apple ships, which are the furniture of a home.
A shop is full of things outside that list: the card reader on the counter, the
monitor behind it, the laptop on the desk, the kettle, the sign. Those arrive
as LiDAR and nothing else, so a check cannot reason about them and the owner
cannot move them.

This walks the capture once and gives them boxes.

    frames        photos, evenly spread across the walk
    detections    one vision pass per frame: what is here, and where in the picture
    people        every person's surface taken out of the mesh first
    carving       each rectangle plus the mesh becomes one measured box
    merging       the same object seen from several places becomes one object
    nodes         a SceneNode per object, sized by LiDAR and named by the photo

The photo only ever supplies a name and a rectangle. Every number comes from
the mesh, so a confident wrong label produces a mislabelled box rather than a
wrong measurement.
