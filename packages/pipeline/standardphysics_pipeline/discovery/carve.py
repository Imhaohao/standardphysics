"""Turning a rectangle drawn on a photo into a measured box in the room.

A detector says "payment terminal, these pixels". That names the thing but
gives it no size, so the LiDAR supplies every dimension and the photo only
supplies the identity. Three filters stand between the rectangle and the box.

**Behind the camera, or outside the frame.** Dropped by projection.

**Hidden.** A rectangle drawn around a terminal also covers the wall metres
behind it. A depth buffer built from the LiDAR faces keeps only the points the
camera could actually see through those pixels.

**Behind the thing named.** Even the visible points inside the rectangle
include whatever lies past the object's silhouette. The nearest populated
depth band drops the far half of the room, and clustering the rest by space
separates the object from what remains: of those pieces, the one whose
outline matches the rectangle is what the detector was looking at.

What survives is fitted as a box that may turn about Z but never tips, because
a terminal on a counter stands upright and a tilted box would misreport both
its footprint and its height.
