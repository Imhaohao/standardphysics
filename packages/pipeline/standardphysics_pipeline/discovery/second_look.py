"""A second look at an object whose name the photos never agreed on.

The detector names what it sees in one frame, often small and at an angle, and
across a walk the same object collects a spread of names. Most spreads settle:
"sanitizer", "hand sanitizer" and "sanitizer dispenser" pool into one name. Some
never do. On Share-Tea a hand-sanitizer dispenser on the bar ledge collected
chair, dispenser, payment terminal, sign, tablet and speaker in six walks, and
whichever name happened to lead decided whether the reach check ever saw it.

So an object whose leading name has less than three quarters of the support
behind it is looked at again: its best close-ups, cut from the photos that saw it
largest, go to the vision model together with one question, what is this.
The answer replaces the name. Every other object keeps the name its votes gave
it, and a second look that fails keeps it too.

Four things this learned on Share-Tea. The earlier guesses are not shown: given
"payment terminal" among them, the model picked it for a napkin dispenser it
named correctly on its own. The close-ups are the sharpest of the largest
views, because a walk blurs many frames and a blurred one reads as anything.
And a second look never makes something a counter or a table: a blurred crop
of a kitchen pillar came back as a counter 81 inches high, and a work surface
needs the mesh to show one, not a name. The model is asked at temperature zero
and may answer 'unclear': sampled freely, the same fridge-top crops came back
as a paper towel dispenser once and a napkin dispenser the next time.
