"""What a vision model sees in one captured frame, in that frame's own pixels.

RoomPlan only boxes the furniture categories Apple ships, so a payment
terminal, a monitor or a laptop reaches us as unclaimed LiDAR and nothing
else. This asks a grounding model what is in the picture and where, and the
answer is a pixel rectangle we can turn back into mesh points.

**The model is shown the room the way up a person saw it.** Frames are stored
exactly as the camera delivered them, which on a phone held upright is on its
side. A detector shown a sideways photo reads a person on a sofa as lying down
and the laptop on their knees as a chair or a box. So the image is turned
upright for the model using the interface orientation the phone recorded.

**Boxes come back in sensor pixels.** The pose intrinsics describe the stored
sensor grid, so every rectangle is turned back into it before anything projects
through it. The turn is undone exactly once, here, and nothing downstream
knows the photo was ever rotated.

**Boxes arrive as Gemini writes them**: `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]`, each value
0-1000 of the image's height or width. Asking for the convention the model was
trained on gets better corners than asking it to translate.

A frame is worth asking about more than once. Reading a whole walk means
hundreds of requests in a couple of minutes, and at that rate a few come back
rate-limited or with a truncated body. Those are retried with a widening,
jittered wait, because one frame lost to a blip is an object that silently
never existed. A rate limit is the host saying "later", not "broken": it gets
more attempts, the wait the host asks for, and that wait is shared by every
request in flight so the whole walk backs off together instead of each thread
spending its attempts against the same full budget.

**The model is asked not to reason where the host allows it.** With reasoning
on, the Fireworks detector spent 1,000-2,300 generated tokens and 15-22 s per
photo; off, about 320-500 tokens and 5-6 s. The account's limit is generated
tokens per minute, so this is what lets a whole walk be read in a few minutes.

A request that fails every attempt raises. Nothing here returns an empty list
to mean the network was down: a silent fallback reads downstream as a room
with nothing in it.
