"""Which floor the scan actually saw, as a grid a rearrangement can be held to.

RoomPlan reports a floor as one convex sheet, and the sheet covers corners the
phone never pointed at. The LiDAR mesh is the record of what it did point at.
A cell of the grid is observed when the mesh has a face lying down at floor
height over it, or when a piece the scan measured stood over it: floor hidden
under a display case was still seen, as floor with a display case on it.

The grid is measured once, at ingest, in the room frame of that moment, and
rides on the graph. Reading it back maps a point through the floor's own
movement since then, so placing a room elsewhere moves its grid with it.
