"""Taking people out of the displayed scan and closing the holes they leave in furniture.

People were in the room while it was scanned. The LiDAR recorded them as surface
and the photos coloured the furniture with their clothes: on one office a person
sat in a chair in most of the photos and was an eighth of the scan. Discovery
already finds the points a person occupied, so the picture of the room drops
them. The seat under a person was hidden from the scanner too, so what is left
is a hole in the chair; a hole small enough to be one gap in one object is
closed across its rim, the way a seat or a backrest runs on under a person.

Display only, like every patch: checks measure the LiDAR as captured, where
discovery removes people by the same rule before anything is measured.
