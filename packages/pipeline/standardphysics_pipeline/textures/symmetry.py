"""Completing half-seen furniture from its own other half.

A chair against a wall shows the scanner one side, and a sofa seen from the room
shows its front and one arm. Most furniture is the same on the left as on the
right, so the side the scanner saw says what the other looks like. Whether an
object is symmetric is not read off its name: its scanned points are reflected
across each upright plane through its measured box and scored two ways. Agreement
is how much of the reflection lands on scanned surface. Contradiction is how much
lands in space a camera saw straight through to something behind, which is known
to be empty. A chair reflected front to back puts its backrest where every photo
saw the seat and the floor, so that plane fails, while left to right lands on the
other armrest or behind the chair where no camera looked. Reflected surface is
added only where the scan has none and no camera saw through, and later takes
the colour of the point it was reflected from.

Display only, and marked as inferred like every other added surface.
