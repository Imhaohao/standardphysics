"""The painted scan as photographs laid over its surface, rather than one colour per vertex.

A vertex-coloured scan is only as sharp as its vertices are close together, and
once it is thinned for the viewer they sit ten to fifteen centimetres apart, so
a shelf of books reads as a smear. Here the thinned mesh is unwrapped and every
texel, about two centimetres of surface, is coloured from the photographs.

Every photo of the walk is read, not an evenly spaced sixty. More photos mean a
closer, squarer view of each patch of surface and fewer patches nobody saw.
They are read one at a time and let go, twice: once to even out exposure between
them and once to bake, so memory stays flat however long the walk was.

Occlusion is judged against the unwrapped surface itself, sampled texel by
texel, so a surface the thinning moved a few centimetres is not hidden by the
full-resolution scan it no longer quite lies on.

A texel no photo reached takes the colour the vertex painting gave that stretch
of surface, which is itself a photograph or the room's generated material.
