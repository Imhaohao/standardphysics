"""The whole library floor: several room captures, each painted, then set side by side.

`paint_the_scan` colours one capture in its own room frame. A floor is several captures
that were walked separately, so each one arrives in its own frame with its own idea of
where the origin is. This module paints each room by the same pass, fills the vertices no
camera reached, and applies the caller's 4x4 `to_floor` matrix to move the room to where
it belongs relative to the others.

The rooms are concatenated, not welded. Where two captures cover the same stretch of
floor, that stretch appears in the output twice, held apart by whatever residual the
caller's registration left, and a viewer shows both copies fighting for the same pixels.
Welding them would mean deciding which capture is right about the surface, and nothing
here knows that.

Coverage reports the share of vertices a camera actually measured. Filling gives every
vertex a colour so the finished model has no grey holes, but a filled vertex carries a
neighbour's colour rather than a measurement and is never counted as one.
