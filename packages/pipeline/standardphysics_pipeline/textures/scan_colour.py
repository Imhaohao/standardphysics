"""Painting the scanned surface itself, rather than the boxes that stand in for it.

The measured model is boxes, and boxes are the right shape for measuring a gap,
colliding with a wheelchair and being dragged across a floor. They are the
wrong shape to photograph. On a real capture the generated box tops miss the
surfaces under them by inches — a chair by twenty-one, a bench by twenty, a
sofa by eight — and a photo projected onto a plane floating above the thing it
depicts slides sideways with the viewing angle. That is why a laptop keyboard
ends up painted flat across a desk: the pixels are real, the surface they land
on is not where the surface is.

The LiDAR mesh has no such gap, because it *is* the surface. The tabletop sits
at the tabletop's height and the laptop standing on it is geometry, so a photo
lands where it belongs and the laptop occludes the desk by simply being in the
way.

Colour goes on the vertices rather than into an atlas. The mesh already has a
vertex every centimetre or so, which is finer than the photos resolve at room
distance, and it means no unwrapping, no charts, no seams and no gutters.
