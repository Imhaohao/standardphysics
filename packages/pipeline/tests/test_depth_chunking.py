"""Occluding a camera's view in chunks sees exactly what one pass would.

A long walk builds a mesh too large to transform into a camera's frame all at
once, and the bake used to refuse rather than allocate for it. It works through
the faces in batches now, which is only allowed to be faster, never different:
the buffer keeps the nearest of whatever it is shown, so the batch size must
not change a single texel.

Checked against rooms really scanned on this machine. A mesh written here would
be a mesh arranged to survive the test.
