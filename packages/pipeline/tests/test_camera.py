"""The photo-to-model projection, pinned.

Every photo-driven feature stands on this module, and a sign error in it is
invisible: a flipped axis still lands every point somewhere plausible in the
image, just on the wrong thing. These tests fix the conventions so that a later
change has to argue with them.

The arrangement throughout: the camera sits at the ARKit origin with an identity
transform, so it looks down ARKit -Z with ARKit +Y towards the top of the
sensor. The room frame turns that Y-up world into Z-up, so a point two metres
in front of the camera is at room (0, 2, 0).

Every pose here is `image_orientation="sensor"`, because that is the only thing
`PoseRecord.projectable` accepts. The JPEG is written straight from the pixel
buffer and never turned, so the intrinsics describe it as stored; rotating for a
human to look at is a display concern and must not reach this maths.
