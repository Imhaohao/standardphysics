"""Patching the holes a real phone scan left in its ceiling and across its table tops.

The capture is datasets/phone/test1, a classroom whose ceiling sits more than
four metres up. The LiDAR reached that ceiling in stretches, and the tables it
did see are pocked with gaps where the phone measured nothing, while some of
the chairs were never seen from above at all. Where patches belong is decided
by the scan itself, so the checks below read the scan rather than a hand-built
room.
