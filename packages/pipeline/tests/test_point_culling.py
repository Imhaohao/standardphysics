"""Asking each photo only about the part of the scan in its frame gives the answers asking about all of it gave.

A merged library floor has thousands of photos, and projecting the whole floor
through every one of them was most of a texture build's time on a small server.
Culling by the cubes a frame reaches is only allowed to be faster, never
different, so these compare it with the whole-scan answer on a room really
scanned on this machine.
