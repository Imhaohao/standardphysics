    turned `rotation_z_degrees` about `origin`, the corner of the cell with the lowest x and y. A cell's clear width
    is the widest circle centred on it that stays clear, the number a route through that point is checked against.

    `widths_png` holds one 8-bit grey PNG pixel per cell, base64. The first row is the row with the highest y, so it
    reads as a plan drawn with y up. 0 marks a cell nobody can stand on: something blocks it, or it is off the floor
    a trip through the shop may use. Any other value is the clear width in steps of `width_step_inches`, rounded
    down, and 255 also stands for anything wider. Rounding down means no cell reads wider than the grid measured, and
    the bands split at whole steps, so a stored cell sits in the same band its unrounded width does. The grid itself
    resolves 25 mm, about an inch of width, which is why the pinch widths come from the footprints instead.
